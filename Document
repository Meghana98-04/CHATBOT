1. Problem Statement
Chatbots are limited by the static knowledge encoded at the time of deployment, which reduces their ability to provide up-to-date responses. In dynamic domains like news, research, or product information, a chatbot must continuously incorporate new knowledge to remain relevant. The goal is to design a system that enables a chatbot to dynamically update its knowledge base and improve its response accuracy over time.

Objective:
Implement a mechanism to fetch new data periodically from specified sources (e.g., RSS feeds, APIs, documents).
Update the chatbot’s vector database automatically without manual intervention.
Ensure the chatbot can reference this new information in real-time responses.

2. Dataset
The dataset in this scenario is not static. It consists of documents, web pages, or structured data that are continuously added to the knowledge base.
Example Sources:
PDF reports, DOCX files, or CSV datasets stored in a directory
Web pages or RSS feeds from trusted sources
Company knowledge base or internal documentation

Preprocessing:
Convert documents into text (PDF → text, DOCX → text)
Clean text (remove special characters, stopwords if necessary)
Split into manageable chunks for embedding
Generate embeddings using an NLP model (e.g., OpenAI’s text-embedding models)

3. Methodology
Overview: Implement a pipeline that automatically updates the vector database at regular intervals.

Steps:
Data Ingestion:
Periodically fetch new documents or content from specified sources.
Example: Run a cron job every 24 hours or a cloud scheduler to fetch updates.

Text Processing & Embedding:
Split new documents into chunks.
Generate embeddings using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI embeddings).

Vector Database Update:
Check if new content already exists in the database (avoid duplicates).
Insert new embeddings into the vector database (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate).

Chatbot Integration:
When the chatbot receives a query, it retrieves relevant chunks from the vector database.
Use retrieved content to generate responses via an LLM.
Automation & Scheduling:
Implement a scheduled pipeline (Python + cron, or cloud functions) to automate ingestion and embedding.

Evaluation Metrics:
Relevance of responses (manual or automated evaluation)
Frequency of knowledge updates successfully incorporated
Latency of new information appearing in chatbot responses

4. Expected Results
After implementing the system:
The chatbot will incorporate newly added documents or data automatically without manual intervention.
Users will receive up-to-date responses even for newly published content.
The vector database will grow dynamically, maintaining relevance over time.



Outcome: A chatbot that remains current and accurate, capable of adapting to a constantly evolving information environment.
